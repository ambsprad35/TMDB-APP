# TMDB-APP
Contains code for an application that pulls data from the TMDB website and displays the top trending movies and shows.
The application is a hybrid-framework application, working on both web and mobile devices.
When the application loads, it will display a thumbnail image and the title of the current trending movies on the TMDB website. 
Each image is clickable and once clicked, a modal window pops up, displaying the movie title, release date and number of users 
who have foavorited the movie.  Clicking on Trending Shows at the bottom displays the current trending tv shows on the TMDB website 
in the same manner as the movies.  Clicking on a show's image will also display a modal window that displays the full tv show name
along with the last air date and the number of users who have added the show to their watchlist.
